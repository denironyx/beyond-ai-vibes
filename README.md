# Beyond AI & Vibes

A creative lab where I explore AI, data, and software tools every 2–3 weeks, not to follow trends, but to vibe with them, remix them, and push past them.

##  What is this?

**Beyond AI Vibes** is a living repo for short, focused experiments that explore:

- Emerging AI tools & frameworks  
- Data workflows & visualizations  
- Machine learning models & pipelines  
- Generative AI, LLM agents, and more  

Each sprint is 30 minutes to 4 hours of hands-on building, reflecting, and learning. Sometimes it’s structured. Sometimes it’s chaotic. Always exploratory.

## Rhythm

Every 2–3 weeks:
1. Pick a new tool, question, or technique
2. Build something tiny but real
3. Log what worked, what didn’t, and what felt… interesting

## Repo Structure



## why "Beyond AI Vibes"?

This is a space for remixing ideas that don’t fit cleanly into templates. If something breaks or goes off-script, even better.
